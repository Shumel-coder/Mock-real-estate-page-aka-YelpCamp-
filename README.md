# Mock-real-estate-page-aka-YelpCamp-
Mock real estate site using MEN stack. 
This was a code along project called yelpcamp on colt-steele's web developer course(udemy). I changed it slightly to be a real estate site. You can create an account, add properties with photos and prices etc. You can also view properties posted by others. I used MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and node.js as well as a few other js libraries to build the app. I also included a map api that shows where the properties posted are located.
